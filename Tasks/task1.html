        <h2>main idea about cats</h2>
        <p> In most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, 
            long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few. Just like us humans, the things cats find interesting, 
            fun, or exciting can change as they age—your cat may love her toy with feathers one day, but find it boring the next.
