    <p style="color:orange ; padding-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Thus flower is a shoot
        bearing sporophyll. Flowering plants have
        successfully colonised
        land by reducing the
        water dependent gametophytic generation to the point where it is entirely protected within the sporophytic
        generation.Typically flower is a condensed branch in which internodes have become condensed, bringing the nodes
        close to one another, and the leaves are modified to form floral whorls that directly or indirectly participate
        in the process of reproduction. Flowers differ considerably in size, shape, colour and arrangement of their
        parts, yet most of them bear a common structural plan.</p>

    <p ; style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px"> <span style="font-weight:bolder;">Inline CSS </span>In all
        social
        functions, use of flowers and garlands has
        become
        symbolic. Annual, commonly, cultivated flowers
        are Carnation, Aster, Clendula, Petunia, Pansy, Nasturtium, Phlox, Zinnia, Marigold etc. Some other flowers
        usually grown in gardens are Antirrhinum, Portulaca, Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Cosmos, Larkspur, Poppy, Stock,
        Sweet pea, Sweet William, Verbena. Common bulbous flowers are Narcissus, Iris, Spider lily, Nerine, Tulips etc.

        Floriculture is the branch of ornamental horticulture concerned with growing and marketing of flowers and
        ornamental plants, as well as with flower arrangement.</p>
